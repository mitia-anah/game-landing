## Resources

I had to start from the scratch to set all the sources. I created image folder to se store all the images that I used. So with downloading the fonts as well. They are placed in the fonts folder.

## Development

The `webroot` folder is where all my work go. 

## Installing node-sass
- I started with installing node-sass. To do that:
    * run the npm init
    * press enter until you reach the right destination
    * that is finished, run this command now: `npm i -D node-sass`, this is to how we get the module.
    * If you run `git status`, you will see a new folder called `node_module`. Go to your vsCode and create a .gitignore file and add the node_module name there. Why we do that? we ignore that folder before pushing all the works we done before.

## Run css

* npm run css:watch
